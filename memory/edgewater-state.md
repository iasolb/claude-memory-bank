As of 2026-07-18: `Work/Edgewater/EdgewaterDB` (github.com/iasolb/EdgewaterDB,
main) is the active codebase, last commit 2026-07-01 "frontend final pass."
FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + HTMX/Tailwind v4 PWA, Dockerized, 15 routers, templates
split by audience (employee/ vs management/ vs admin/) per the two-UX
principle.

Superseded, do not build on: `edgewater_attempt1` (old Streamlit stack),
`edgewater_api_cleanup` (its api/ layout was absorbed into EdgewaterDB),
top-level `EdgewaterMasterCleaner` (a copy lives inside EdgewaterDB, the
top-level one is likely stale).

Roadmap lives in-repo: `docs/inventory-redesign.md` (redesign inventory and
sales around a stock-ledger core table, with migration plan and open
questions) is the active forward plan; `docs/frontend-design.md` is the
design system (Component system v2, 2026-07-01). Obsidian vault notes are
mostly historical.

`database/datasource/Passwords.csv` is tracked on purpose: the credentials
in it are fake dev-seed data, the repo is private, and Ian wants it tracked
for convenience during development (confirmed 2026-07-18). Don't re-flag it.
