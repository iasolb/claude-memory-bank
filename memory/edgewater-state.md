As of 2026-07-18: `Work/Edgewater/EdgewaterDB` (github.com/iasolb/EdgewaterDB,
main) is the active codebase, last commit 2026-07-01 "frontend final pass"
(plus a same-day "sync to other machine" commit once it was also cloned onto
the PC, see [[pc-layout]]). FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + HTMX/Tailwind v4 PWA,
Dockerized, 14 routers (`main.py`: pwa/auth/home/map/plant/harvest/pitch/
sales/inventory/plantings/orders/labels/admin/users), templates split by
audience (employee/ vs management/ vs admin/) per the two-UX principle.

Superseded, do not build on: `edgewater_attempt1` (old Streamlit stack),
`edgewater_api_cleanup` (its api/ layout was absorbed into EdgewaterDB),
top-level `EdgewaterMasterCleaner` (a copy lives inside EdgewaterDB, the
top-level one is likely stale).

Roadmap lives in-repo: `docs/inventory-redesign.md` (redesign inventory and
sales around a stock-ledger core table, with migration plan and open
questions) is the active forward plan; `docs/frontend-design.md` is the
design system (Component system v2, 2026-07-01). Obsidian vault notes are
mostly historical.

2026-07-22: the PC is now in Boston and becomes the primary Edgewater dev
machine; the Mac shifts to a productivity/personal role. PC clone was already
current (same "sync to other machine." head). Not-in-git items identified for
the handoff: `.env` (10 dev keys), `source/Edgewater Master.xlsx` (legacy
master spreadsheet, gitignored), `.claude/settings.local.json`. Dev DB
re-seeds itself from tracked SQL/CSVs on a fresh `edgewater_db_data` volume,
so app-entered Mac data is disposable unless Ian says otherwise. Also fixed
machine-sync's stale `LOCAL_ROOT` (Desktop -> Documents/MAINFRAME) this day.

`database/datasource/Passwords.csv` is tracked on purpose: the credentials
in it are fake dev-seed data, the repo is private, and Ian wants it tracked
for convenience during development (confirmed 2026-07-18). Don't re-flag it.
See [[mainframe-layout]].
