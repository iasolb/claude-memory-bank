Resolved 2026-07-19: the "proper pipeline for filing things between systems"
became **machine-sync**, built this session inside the myToolBox monorepo at
`~/claude/myToolBox` on the PC (git repo, committed and pushed by Ian
2026-07-19; the mystery
"ssh tooling system" turned out to be his work `workbench-sync` utility,
kept locally at `myToolBox/workbench-sync-master` and gitignored as
Wayfair-derived reference).

What machine-sync is: peer-to-peer tar-over-ssh transfer, commands on both
machines. PC gets `pull.mac`/`push.mac`/`pull.mac.claude`/`push.mac.claude`
(PowerShell profile functions), Mac gets `pull.pc`/`push.pc`/
`pull.pc.claude`/`push.pc.claude`. Hybrid path model (relative resolves
against configured roots: `Documents\mf` on PC, `~/Desktop/MAINFRAME` on
Mac; absolute passes through). `*.claude` variants target the claude working
dir (`~/claude/session/working` on both). Optional `--csv` runs
`csv-utf8/ensure_utf8.py` (toolbox tool #2) over the destination. Config at
`~/.machine-sync.ps1` / `~/.machine-sync.env`; ignore list at
`~/.machinesync-ignore`, never excludes `.git`.

State as of 2026-07-19 (evening, Mac session):
- Both sides installed. Mac: `install-mac.sh` run, seeded
  `~/.machine-sync.env` defaults were already correct (MAINFRAME root,
  `~/claude/session/working`), bin dir on PATH via `~/.zshrc`, `Host pc`
  alias added (see [[pc-ssh-access]]).
- First live transfer verified: `pull.pc.claude --from
  personal/notes/websites-to-remember.txt` landed byte-correct in the
  claude working dir (test copy deleted after).
- PC->Mac ssh live 2026-07-19 (Remote Login enabled) and the FULL E2E
  checklist passed from the PC: dir pull with ignore filtering, single-file
  pull, both claude variants, pushes to new/existing destinations, --csv
  conversion verified byte-exact. Hardening that came out of it (all in
  machine-sync, commit staged for Ian):
  - `Host mac` pins IP 10.0.0.9, NOT the .local name: Windows mDNS
    resolution is intermittent (works maybe half the time). If transfers
    fail, the Mac's DHCP lease drifted; durable fix is a router reservation.
    `StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new` is set.
  - PC PowerShell resolves ssh AND tar to Git for Windows' builds (PATH
    shadowing); scripts pin System32 natives explicitly. Git's ssh cannot
    resolve .local; Git's GNU tar cannot take `C:\` in `-C`.
  - PC has OpenSSH 9.5p1: scp is SFTP-mode, remote paths are literal, never
    quote-wrap them.
  - ssh probes use `-n` (else they eat stdin meant for the y/N confirm) and
    treat ssh exit 255 as "peer unreachable, abort" rather than "false".
  - Push confirm fails closed ($null from Read-Host at stdin EOF bypassed
    -notmatch; the work reference tool has this same latent bug).
  - The Mac's non-interactive `python3` is a BROKEN xcode-select shim
    (dlopen error, Xcode CLT damage; interactive shells get a real one).
    push --csv to the Mac therefore skips gracefully. Ian may want to fix
    CLT on the Mac (`xcode-select --install`) to light that path up.
- Python 3.13.14 installed on the PC via winget 2026-07-19 (Ian's choice),
  user PATH puts it ahead of the Store stubs in any new terminal. csv-utf8
  verified end-to-end on it (cp1252/utf-16/utf-8-sig fixtures converted,
  idempotent second pass). charset-normalizer not installed, stdlib
  fallback in use.
- Confirmed: `pull.pc.claude --from` takes a PC path (spec typo).
